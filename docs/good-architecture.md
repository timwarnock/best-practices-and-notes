# Good Architecture

What are the characteristics of Good Architecture? Opinions vary, but what can the data tell us?

## Focus on Engineers

Architects must focus on Engineers and not tools or technologies.

Choose tools and technologies that empower the engineers to produce the right outcomes. What are the right outcomes? Solutions to customer's problems. Nothing more.


## Loosely Coupled

Empowered teams are responsibile to create the right solutions which are loosely coupled from one another.  This is the most important part of software architecture.
