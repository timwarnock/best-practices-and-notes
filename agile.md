# Time for Agile to Die

"Agile often puts processes over people, and it’s pushing women engineers into non-technical roles."

"At the time, software development was suffering from a mistaken belief: that building things fast and building things well were fundamentally opposed."

"Yes, customers want functions and features, Mary said, but more than that, they want solutions to their problems."

"Agile was very good at delivering features, but it didn’t make any difference. Companies were no better off when they had features faster than when they had features slower. The focus needs to be not on features, not on output, but on outcomes and the impact of what employees are doing."

Today, however, many don’t view software development as an engineering endeavor — or, more likely, are unable to because of obstacles in their organizations, Mary said. Engineering is about seeing a problem, understanding it and using the technology you're good at to solve it as quickly as possible. Software, she said, has become about "projects, briefings and being nice to people."

"Way too much of agile has been not about technology, but about people and about managing things and about getting stuff done — not necessarily getting the right stuff done, but getting stuff done — rather than what engineering is about," she said. 

**"Agile has come to mean anything but the fundamental, underlying technical capability necessary to do really good software engineering."**

"They want a process to make sure that software is done right, instead of considering that maybe their fundamental concept of what software is is wrong," she said. "Find me an actual tech company that talks much about agile, and I will be astounded."

“If you look at agile, where do women end up? They end up being scrum masters and that kind of thing. That’s not an engineering job. That’s putting women ‘in a woman’s place,’ rather than putting women in an engineering job. And I think that’s really bad,” she said.

"According to Mary, if agile methodology creates more non-technical roles and steals focus from technical problem-solving, its continued popularity could work against women developers."
