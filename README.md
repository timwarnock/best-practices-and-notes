# best-practices-and-notes

Playing around with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), and capturing best practices and notes (in a very opinionated way).

## Managing with MkDocs

You'll need `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material` theme

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Building/compiling the site

```bash
mkdocs build
```


Running a localhost server

```bash
mkdocs server
```


Deploying to github pages

```
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
